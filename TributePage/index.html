            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Dr. Wang embarked on his scientific journey at Tsinghua University, where he earned his PhD degree in
                2014.</p>

            <h2>Career and Contributions</h2>
            <p>Dr. Wang currently serves as a Research Fellow at the University of Texas and a scintist at Regeneron
                Pharmaceuticals. His work has been cited over 18,446 times since 2019, reflecting the impact and reach
                of his research.</p>

        <div class="research">
            <h2>Groundbreaking Research</h2>
            <p>During his PhD, he determined the structural mechanism of MERS-CoV receptor recognition. In partnership
                with Linqi Zhang's lab in 2014, they isolated the first monoclonal neutralizing antibody against
                MERS-CoV.</p>
            <p>In 2016, he developed a universal method to lock the shapeshifting S protein in the "prefusion" state by
                introducing two prolines into the protein. This technology, known as S-2P, was successfully applied in
                at least five major COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <div class="publications">
            <p>Dr. Wang's research has been in numerous high-impact journals. Some of his most cited works include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation</li>
                <li>SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine design</li>
                <li>Immunogenecity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen</li>
